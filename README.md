## AI Transcript Analysis System

A sophisticated AI-powered question-answering system for therapy session transcripts, built with LangChain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and modern web technologies.

### üéØ Overview

This system allows users to ask natural language questions about a therapy session transcript and receive intelligent, context-aware answers with relevant quotes and confidence scores. The AI agent uses advanced retrieval techniques to find relevant information and generates responses using GPT-4.

### ‚ú® Features

#### Core Functionality

- ü§ñ Intelligent Q&A: AI agent that understands and answers questions about the transcript.
- üìù Context-Aware Responses: Provides relevant quotes from the original conversation.
- üéØ Confidence Scoring: Each response includes a confidence level (0-100%).
- üí¨ Natural Language Processing: Handles complex questions about emotions, timeline, and relationships.

#### User Experience

- üìä Real-time Analytics: Usage statistics, popular questions, and system performance metrics.
- üíæ Persistent History: All Q&A interactions saved to PostgreSQL database.
- üîÑ Auto-refresh: Analytics and history update automatically as you use the system.

## üìä AI Implementation Details

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline

#### 1. Document Processing
- Parse therapy transcript into conversation turns
- Create document chunks with speaker metadata
- Generate conversation context windows for better understanding

#### 2. Embedding Generation
- Convert text chunks to vector embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Store embeddings in memory vector store for fast retrieval

#### 3. Question Processing
- Generate embedding for user question
- Find most similar transcript chunks using cosine similarity
- Retrieve top 4 most relevant conversation segments

#### 4. Answer Generation
- Create context-aware prompt with retrieved segments
- Generate response using GPT-4o-mini
- Extract relevant quotes and calculate confidence score

## Key AI Features
- **Semantic Search**: Understands meaning, not just keywords
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation flow and speaker context
- **Quote Attribution**: Identifies specific relevant excerpts
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for each response

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Database Schema
- **qa_history**: Stores all questions, answers, quotes, and confidence scores
- **Indexes**: Optimized for timestamp-based queries and analytics

### Metrics Tracked

- Total questions asked
- Average confidence score
- Most popular questions
- Recent activity with timestamps
- Processing time per question

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for production deployment

### Core Infrasturcture
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement comprehensive user management with role-based access control, session security, and multi-tenant support
- **Vector Database Integration**: Replace ephemeral embedding generation with persistent vector storage using Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma to eliminate recomputation overhead and enable faster query responses
- **Scalable Architecture**: Containerization with Docker, horizontal scaling capabilities, and load balancing for production workloads

### AI & Analytics Capabilities
- **Multi-Session Analysis**: Support for analyzing multiple transcripts simultaneously with cross-session insights and comparative analytics
- **Dynamic Speaker Detection**: Automatically parse speaker names from transcript formatting, extract conversation context, and generate contextually relevant questions based on dialogue content rather than using hardcoded static transcripts
- **Enhanced RAG System**:
   - Experiment with state-of-the-art embedding models (e.g., OpenAI Ada-002, Sentence-BERT variants, domain-specific models)
   - Implement comprehensive benchmarking framework to evaluate accuracy, relevance, and truthfulness across diverse transcript types
   - Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword-based retrieval
